    <h1>A Letter, a Warning and Christmas Presents</h1>
    <p>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,</p>
    <p>I hope this email finds you well. I’m writing to warn you of what's to come and bring you two Christmas presents that I hope will help equip Christians globally to defend against the disaster that I believe will bring about the economic catastrophe described in <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/6/Revelation-6-6.html" target="_blank">Revelation 6:6</a> on a global scale.</p>
    <p>I wrote a rather emotionally charged open letter to churches earlier last week, but after the humbling events of the last few days, I have learned my lesson and decided to tone down the language that I use in my writings. To put it simply, I have gone from dropping theological nuclear bombs to sprinkling extra-potent salt.</p>
    <p>I believe we are less than two years away from an economic disaster brought about by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will result in over 90% unemployment globally. You can read about my argument and reasoning in my posts titled "<a href="https://blog.biblesays.love/posts/defcon-1" target="_blank">DEFCON 1</a>", "<a href="https://blog.biblesays.love/posts/on-aerodynamics" target="_blank">On Aerodynamics</a>", "<a href="https://blog.biblesays.love/posts/on-unemployment-rates-inflation" target="_blank">On Unemployment Rates and Inflation</a>", "<a href="https://blog.biblesays.love/posts/on-middle-east" target="_blank">On the Middle East</a>", "<a href="https://blog.biblesays.love/posts/on-what-i-think-will-happen" target="_blank">On What I Think Will Happen</a>" and "<a href="https://blog.biblesays.love/posts/on-throwing-up" target="_blank">On Throwing Up</a>".</p>
    <p>The TL;DR is employers are likely to figure out they could do everything you are doing right now with nearly zero cost and in seconds using AI within 2 years if your work is not more complicated than aerodynamics. And that’s just what AI is capable of today, only God knows what AI will be capable of in 2 years.</p>
    <p>Despite the grim outlook of what's to come, I believe the following Christmas presents will help Christians globally to put on the full armour of God as well as preach the gospel to unbelievers, considering the suffering that is to come.</p>
    <p><a href="https://blog.biblesays.love/posts/on-cheating-bible-says-love" target="_blank">Project Bible Says Love</a> (<a href="https://biblesays.love/" target="_blank">BibleSays.Love</a>) is a helper tool to help Christians live Bible-guided lives. It is meant to be a helper tool only and should always lead the user back to scripture and the importance of context should not be neglected.</p>
    <p>I also constructed a theological/philosophical/epistemological argument that I believe proves faith precedes reason. You can read about the argument in my post titled "<a href="https://blog.biblesays.love/posts/on-faith-precedes-reason" target="_blank">On Faith Precedes Reason</a>".</p>
    <p>The rest of the posts are my testimony. Apologies in advance for some of the language I used. I was rather emotional when I wrote them. I decided to prioritise truth and honesty over appearances and kept the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
    <p>Here is my final message to you. He is coming back. There will be hard times ahead. Please hold onto your faith and best wishes.</p>
    <p>For Love and Devotion,<br>From Your Fellow Servant,<br>Jonah Troublemaker Yang</p>
    <p>24 December 2024<br>London, United Kingdom</p>
